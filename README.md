# Chatbot Project

This is a simple AI-powered chatbot built using Python, TensorFlow, and Tkinter for the GUI. The chatbot processes user input, predicts the intent using a trained deep learning model, and provides responses accordingly.

## Features

Uses NLP techniques for text processing

Deep learning model for intent recognition

GUI built with Tkinter

Supports multiple intents with varied responses

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using:

pip install numpy tensorflow nltk pickle-mixin

Additionally, download the NLTK resources:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')

## Files Overview

chatbot.py: Core chatbot logic for handling user input, intent prediction, and response generation.

app.py: Tkinter-based GUI application for the chatbot.

intents.json: Defines various intents and corresponding responses.

chatbotmodel.h5: Trained deep learning model for intent classification.

words.pkl and classes.pkl: Preprocessed data used for prediction.

## Running the Chatbot

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

To run the chatbot in the terminal:

**python chatbot.py**

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

To launch the GUI version:

**python app.py**

## Training the Model

If you need to retrain the chatbot, ensure you have a script that processes the intents.json file, tokenizes text, and trains a neural network. You can create a script like train.py for this purpose.

## Future Improvements

Enhance the NLP pipeline for better intent recognition

Add more intents and responses

Improve the chatbot's conversational abilities with a larger dataset
